# Keebort Resources

A small repository containing useful links to resources pertaining to Cherry MX-style (for now) mechanical keyboards.

Refer to this [YT Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8AJyqd8OBSjQh1ZHVFlEe6FgRSnn_T9&si=dc55ps5Kq5aa2R7B) for tutorials on various aspects of the hobby.

- Serves as great material for folks to revisit and rehash their knowledge base.
- You are more than welcome to contribute to this playlist thru GitHub Issues or if I post the playlist anywhere else on the net.

[Here](/useful-links.md) are a set of useful links, regardless of your experience in the hobby. If you are more experienced, you can visit these links as well as the [compiled cheap stuff](/cheap-stuff.md) I've found and not miss out on much as of 28 July 2024.

## Want to Contribute?

First and foremost, thank you for considering to contribute :D

Currently, I am opening discussions to GitHub Issues to keep discussions open and transparent among members of the community. As of writing the first few iterations of the repo (mid-July 2024), The mission is, and always will be, to accumulate a breadth of knowledge and resources to share among beginners and enthusiasts (including prospective engineers/designers) alike, so that everyone can benefit from this set of resources.

**Full Disclosure:** I am collaborating with some folks from the Keybroke community to explore making community-driven resources similar to BlackSimon's [chyna](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bcJk5qE1jgwdBjeXSPYOETXIrJMdZbO3QTsZoRxrO0E)/[budget](https://blacksimon.tv/budget) sheets, but I will not be limiting any knowledge/contributions from other communities. Credit where credit is due.

Here are a couple of things I'd love to address in some capacity in the future:

- Gaining some level of organization similar to this [repository](https://github.com/Callsign-Dingo-7/UK-Happy-Hardcore-Resources) that I made for folks who were interested in UK Happy Hardcore music production.
  - I have some ideas in terms of separating keyboard tools, assembly, mods, and design or something along those lines, but I think I need to discuss this with folks who have been in the scene longer than I have to help guide me in the right direction.
- I'm looking around for useful resources for things like designing, programming, and soldering keeborts to beefen this repo up.
