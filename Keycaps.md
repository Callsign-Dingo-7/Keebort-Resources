# Keycaps

This file is not meant to go terribly in-depth about each and every detail about keycaps, but to give a basic TLDR of different aspects of keycaps while pointing you in different directions.

Keycaps are what we use to cover up the backing technologies of the PCB and ultimately interface with the keyboard to enter inputs to the host device. It is one of the most visually striking aspects of the hobby, and is often what drives newbies to explore the hobby.

## Material

The big two materials that are around are ABS and PBT. ABS is the material that most folks are familiar with. The general consensus is that ABS tends to lend itself to a higher pitch compared to PBT. This is because ABS has a lower density compared to PBT.

## Profiles

The most ubiquitous profile among hobbyists today is the Cherry Profile, but there exists many kinds of profiles as shown by [keycaps.info](https://www.keycaps.info/). Do not be afraid to explore other profiles if you have the means to. In my personal experience, I found myself enjoying DSS, MDA, and I look forward to messing around with DCS in the future at some point. Meetups are your best friend :D

Here are some notable profiles that are commonplace throughout users in the hobby, in no particular order:

- Cherry/GMK/CYL
- OEM
- DCX
- DSA
- SA
- XDA (:P)
- MDA
- MT3
